A Brief about XGBRegression : Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an open-source library that provides an efficient and effective implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm.
Shortly after its development and initial release, XGBoost became the go-to method and often the key component in winning solutions for a range of problems in machine learning competitions.
Regression predictive modeling problems involve predicting a numerical value such as a dollar amount or a height. XGBoost can be used directly for regression predictive modeling.
